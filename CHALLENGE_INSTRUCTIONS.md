# Merapar challenge instructions

## On AWS provision a service, using Infrastructure as Code, that serves an html page.

- The content of the page must be: <h1>The saved string is dynamic string</h1>   
- 'dynamic string' can be set to whatever is requested without having to re-deploy.
- When you demonstrate the solution in the interview you will need to modify the string to show it works.
- Any user accessing the URL must get the same result. The URL should be the same no matter what the dynamic string is.
- You will be asked to take us through the source code.

## Accompany this work with a short document (PDF) explaining: 

- Your solution and discussing the available options
- The reasons behind the decisions you made
- How you would embellish the solution were you to have more time. 

## Create a publicly accessible Git repo. Include your code and documentation in the repo.

- Send us a link to the repo when you have completed the challenge.
- NOTE: If you would prefer to use a private repo - that is fine. Upon the receipt of the link we will provide Git logins to allow you to grant us temporary access to view the code.
